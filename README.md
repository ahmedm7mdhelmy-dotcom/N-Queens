N-Queens Backtracking Visualizer
A Java application that visualizes the backtracking algorithm through the N-Queens problem. This project shows how the algorithm explores different solutions and backtracks when a constraint is violated.

Features
Real-time Animation: Visualizes the placement and removal of queens on the board.

Backtracking Indicators: Uses colors to distinguish between successful placements and backtracking steps.

Speed Control: Includes a slider to adjust the animation speed.

Clean Logic: Separation between the solver algorithm and the graphical interface.

Implementation Details
The project consists of two main components:

NQueensSolver: Handles the recursive backtracking logic and records each move (placement or removal) as a step.

NQueensGUI: Manages the visual representation using Java Swing, rendering the steps recorded by the solver.

Tech Stack
Java (JDK 8 or higher)

Java Swing/AWT for the user interface.

How to Run :
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Compile and run the NQueensGUI.java file.

Click "Solve" to start the visualization.
